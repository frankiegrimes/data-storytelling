              <p>Does the digital native generation have a greater understanding of the transgender community than the previous generation? We surveyed 227 people, and interviewed an Irish trans woman, a transgender activist and a gender and sexuality academic to find out.

              <p>How aware are you of the terms that apply to your gender? You’ve probably heard of the term transgender before but what does it actually mean? That’s what the aim of Transcend is, to help inform you through the complexities of the transgender community and your perceptions towards them. A good place to start would be an understanding of what it means to be cisgender.</p>

          <p>Survey conducted in 2016.  227 respondents participated in this purposive quantitative survey in order to gauge their awareness of the transgender community and how this awareness was formed. The results from this survey are not representative of the population of Ireland and cannot be used to make generalisations or sweeping claims about views towards the transgender community. The sampling methodology for data collection used non-problematic methods such as critical case sampling, volunteer sampling and convenience sampling. </p>
